									<h2>Hi There, Welcome!</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm very glad youâ€™re here and interested in learning more about me. Do reach out and introduce yourself, Iâ€™d like to meet you too!</p>

									<h2> So, who am i?</h2>
									<p>								
										As youâ€™ve noticed, Iâ€™m Elad Oz-Cohen, an aspiring data analyst. Iâ€™ve come across both the SQL and R programming languages and statistics during my Master's Degree in Cognitive Psychology,
										 and I have been hooked ever since then. Although this (wonderful!) encounter was not expected, as the phrase goes: "life is like a box of chocolate..."
										During my Master's I've also grown fond of data visualizations. Although my academic research supplied me with plenty of opportunities to visualize data, I craved more opportunities,
										 hence discovering the "TidyTuesday" challenge, which I'll share (some) of my results here. I love the R community, data visualization challenges, 
										 and more recently other languages such as SQL, and Python, and doing baby steps in JS.
										
										Thatâ€™s also what I blog about here. It could be curious questions I came across (such as probability, text-analysis) or challenges I faced somewhere, solved, 
										and would like to share with my future self or you.
										
										Hope you enjoy your visit and again, reach out so I can get to know you better ðŸ˜„
